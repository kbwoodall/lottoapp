# Lotto App

A minimal React + Vite + Tailwind app with a router and a `Lotto` page that displays a message about lotto numbers. The app has a green background (`bg-green-500`).

## Quick start

```bash
cd /home/kerrywoodall/Apps/lotto
npm install
```

Run the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173 and navigate to `/lotto` to see the Lotto page.
